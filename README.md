# Simple Game Engine

This project aims to create a minimal, yet usible, game engine. It is heavily inspired by [the Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine),
with the goal of creating something that abstracts away the complexities of creating graphical, interactive apps and
games. Right now, it's a thin wrapper around [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) (using the [sdl2
crate](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2)) for visuals.

This is highly experimental so far, so if you have any ideas or would like to contribute, please [sub mit an
issue](https;//github.com/mcb2003/audio-game-engine-rs/issues).
