# Audio Game Engine

This project aims to create a minimal, yet usible, game engine, specifically designed for audio games. Right now, it is a thin wrapper around:

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) (using the [sdl2 crate](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2)) for visuals.
* [the tts crate](https://crates.io/crates/tts) for text-to-speech output.
* [the rodio crate](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) for positional audio.

This is highly experimental so far, so if you have any ideas or would like to contribute, please [sub mit an issue](https;//github.com/mcb2003/audio-game-engine-rs/issues).
